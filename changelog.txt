v2.0.4 (1/8/25)
	- Cosmetic changes to achieve compatibility with Max 9 themes without
	  making modules illegible in Max 8.
	- Add TO-AZ and FROM-AZ modules that simply wrap mc.pack~ and mc.unpack~.

v2.0.3 (3/14/24)
	- Fix snapshots not working correctly with GRANUL8R (symptoms: envelope
	  choice not saved, play not working if snapshot taking while playing).
	- Try to prevent some strange syncing problems between multiple inputs
	  affecting a single inlet. (Disabled several change objects to stop
	  trying to optimize away repeated data values.)

v2.0.2 (8/10/23)
	- Fix problem with BANKR and REZON8R: sometimes the right channel would
	  not be affected by the processor, due to an initialization bug.

v2.0.1 (4/3/23)
	- Fix PANR pan value inlet range, and set dial to show pan values the
	  same way the synth modules do (50L...C...50R). Also support exact keyword.

v2.0.0 (3/1/23)
	- Release (no changes from 2.0.0b9)

v2.0.0b9 (2/23/23)
	- Complete documentation for az.granulate~, az.spectdelay~, az.specteq~, and
	  az.strum~ externals.
	- Fix problem with Snapshots and GRANUL8R: opening file having an associated
	  or embedded Snapshot would load correct sound file but not play it. Turns
	  out buffer for az.granulate~ was not set at the right time.
	- New versions of Windows externals, now in sync with Mac ones.
	- Resize help files so that they fit on a 900-pixel tall screen.
	- Fix CAPTR bugs relating to record duration, stereo input, and removed
	  crop feature, which caused a lot of problems. 

v2.0.0b8 (2/13/23)
	- Include latest version of az.strum~ Windows external, so it doesn't crash.
	- Recompile and sign/notarize Mac versions of az.specteq~ and az.spectdelay~
	  externals.

v2.0.0b7 (2/7/23)
	- Work around a change in textedit behavior that caused a file-open dialog
	  to appear for each Auzzie player object in a patch you open (or create).
	- Set minimum Max version required for Auzzie to 8.3.0. This is necessary
	  to properly support BANKR, REZON8R, and PANR.

v2.0.0b6 (1/18/23)
	- If you plug a mono audio cable into an Auzzie inlet, it will now
	  mult it to stereo, instead of ignore it entirely.
	- Rename PLAYR back to APLAYR, FADR to AFADR, FADR-H to AFADR-H to avoid
	  potential conflict with Vizzie modules of the same name.

v2.0.0b5 (1/16/23)
	- Final solution for granulating a buffer whose sampling rate
	  differs from the Max rate: now handled entirely within
	  az.granulate~.
	- Grain envelope types used in Auzzie now built in to az.granulate~.
	- New PANR, FADR, and FADR-H modules.
	- Renamed APLAYR to PLAYR.
	- Additional help files.
	- Many cosmetic tweaks to help files.
	- Full documentation for az externals.

v2.0.0b4 (11/21/22)
	- Additional help tweaks and various minor bug fixes.
	- OUT-H object for horizontal output fader, to save vertical space.

v2.0.0b3 (11/18/22)
	- Updated externals to Max SDK 8.2, with arm64 support on macOS.
	- Changed prefix of externals from "jg" to "az".
	- Tentative support for resampling GRANUL8R buffer when file rate
	  does not match Max rate.

v2.0.0b2 (10/27/22)
	- Supply help files for all module categories and modules, linking from 
	  Extras > Auzzie Overview.
	- In 1SHOTR and STRIKR, show "Drop a sound here" in empty rectangle
	  where sound file basename will appear.
	- Make 1SHOTR and STRIKR play stereo files correctly.
	- Fix stereo width and autopan in BANKR and REZON8R.
	- Clean up module xable (ON|OFF) button UI, dropping these from some
	  modules, when they weren't necessary.
	- Add mute buttons to IN and OUT modules, and add an option to 
	  mult the left to the right channel for IN.
	- Make data inlet/outlet dots white, as in Vizzie.
	- First stab at an icon.
	- Many miscellaneous cleanups in modules.

v2.0.0b1 (10/14/22)
	- First version of mc-ified Auzzie â€” INCOMPATIBLE with v1.
	- Removed the feature added in v1.0.19, because it's too expensive to be
	  worth it and might cause even more confusion in an mc context.
	- Appended '~' to the names of all audio patchers.
	- Better support for snapshots.
	- Convert to qmetro-driven snapshot~, instead of relying on auto mode.
	- Remove gen10, gen24, and dcblock~ external dependencies.
	- Add notch mode to az.rezfiltr~.

v1.0.19 (1/24/22)
	- Audio signals can be sent to Auzzie data inlets. Internally converted to
	  messages using [snapshot~ 20]. Use Max 8.1+ to avoid long-standing
	  snapshot~ bug.
	  NB: There are serious doubts in the forum that this really has been fixed.
	  The recommendation is to clock the object with qmetro, instead of relying
	  on its built-in clock.

v1.0.18 (1/17/22)
	- Signed and notarized all included externals. Removed 32-bit Windows
	  externals.

v1.0.17 (12/24/19)
	- New 2DELAYR module: stereo delay with feedback path filter
	- MIXR-3sx1s and MIXR-4x1 have mute buttons for each fader.
	- Add missing CAPTR and ENVELOPR snippets.
	- Support jit_gl_texture, as well as jit_matrix, messages when convering
	  video output into a 0-1 control source.

v1.0.16 (11/17/19)
	GAMETRAKR module:
	- Fix bug: failed to write calibration file when you close the calibration
	  window.
	- Don't print err. msg. to console when there's no calibration file at load
	  time.
	- User-adjustable "calibration time": time spent moving tethers in each
	  dimension.

v1.0.15 (10/28/19)
	- Fix bug: sending a list of 32 delay times to the second inlet of SDELAYR
	  didn't do anything. Thanks to Jason Choi for finding this.

v1.0.14 (10/07/19)
	- Change name of Auzzie Info patcher to Auzzie Overview.

v1.0.13 (10/06/19)
	- Added snippets, so you can drag Auzzie modules into the patcher from the
	  Snippets icon, instead of digging through the File Browser. Much easier.

v1.0.12 (11/25/18)
	- Fix bug in Max 8: STRIKR and 1SHOTR would not read drag-and-dropped sound
	  files.

v1.0.11 (10/2/17)
	- Support multiple Gametraks connected to the same machine.

v1.0.10 (7/19/17)
	- Change data storage range for freq and cutoff params in COMBR, REZFILTR,
	  REZON8R, and RINGR. These used to be 0-1; now they're 20-20000. If you
	  were sending input into the inlets, this will make no difference, but if
	  you were storing the settings of these modules in pattr presets, the
	  ranges will now be wrong. Take note of your current settings, and correct
	  them in the preset .json files before updating auzzie.  Sorry.

v1.0.9 (5/27/17)
	- Add attack and release times to BANKR, so that notes can fade in and out
	  gracefully.

v1.0.8 (1/12/17)
	- Fixed a bug that could cause a zero as input to a data inlet not to do
	  anything.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the buffer referenced by CAPTR to be cleared when
	  changing presets, even if the capture duration was not changed.

v1.0.7 (10/03/16)
	- Can send "reset" to WAVR and FMODR to stop all sounding notes.

v1.0.6 (9/25/16)
	- New module GAMETRAKR, for using the Gametrak tether controller.
	- New module CAPTR, for creating live-sampling patches, with sound rendered
	  by APLAYR or GRANUL8R, which can now access external buffer~ objects.
	- Changed grain rate and dur dials in GRANUL8R to an exponential curve,
	  giving better resolution at the bottom of the range.

v1.0.5 (9/15/16)
	- New module ENVELOPR, to make phrase envelopes for streams of short notes.
	- Recompilation of jg.* externals for Windows with statically linked C
	  runtime library. This is to avoid Error 126 on some Windows systems.
	- APLAYR inlets that act as switches can accept int 0|1 as well as float.
	- Redo Auzzie Info and Auzzie Example patchers to fit on laptop screens.
	- Numerous cosmetic changes, for consistency.

v1.0.4 (9/06/16)
	- Fixed a bug that could create a pitch glitch at the beginning of a note
	  having a fast attack time in FMODR, NOISR, and WAVR.

v1.0.3 (9/06/16)
	- New generator module: STRUMR (plucked-string synth).
	- Can feed "direct" and "rand" messages to SDELAYR.
	- Increased range of attack and release dials for FMODR, WAVR, and NOISR.
	- Improvements to FMODR, NOISR, and WAVR to reduce stuck notes.
	- More sensible velocity-to-amplitude conversion for FMODR, NOISR, and WAVR.
	- Improvements to FMODR and WAVR to make vibrato phase less correlated
	  between voices, and make changing the polyphony voice-count less glitchy.
	- Fixed filter blowups in certain cases when turning off the filter in NOISR.

v1.0.2 (9/01/16)
	- Screwup in handling version numbers, so skipping this version.

v1.0.1 (8/29/16)
	- Added HEMI-M and HEMI-6 modules for working with hemispherical speakers.
	- Added IN1 module for taking audio input from left channel.

v1.0.0 (8/21/16)
	- Initial port from v0.8 (for Max 6) and extensive overhaul.
